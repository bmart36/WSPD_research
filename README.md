In this work, we focus on the well-separated pair decomposition, a geometric data structure that has many interesting applications in the field of computer graphics.

We propose a parallel implementation of the well-separated pair decomposition computed on the GPU. This implementation is based on the sequential algorithm proposed by Timothy M. Chan.
